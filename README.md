### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
this app takes two names, brews them in a pot of chaos, charm, and cheekiness, and spits out two brutally honest metrics:
-Compatibility Factor ‚Äì The sweet stuff. The spark. The "aww that's cute!"
- Breaker Factor ‚Äì The spicy stuff. The "uh oh..." moments that might just ruin the vibe.

‚öô Process of Working

Here's how Match Breaker does its magic:

1. Input Names:
The user enters two names ‚Äî it could be a couple, friends, enemies, or even celebrity crushes. No one is safe.

2. Name Magic Begins:
The names are processed through a playful logic system (we won‚Äôt call it ‚Äúrandom,‚Äù but... it might be).

3. Generate Factors:
-- Compatibility Factor: A fun score that represents how well the two names vibe together. Expect compliments, chaos, and a bit of romance.
-- Breaker Factor: The opposite of sparks flying. This score digs into the potential drama, red flags, and name-based doom.

4. Display Results:
Both scores are shown on the screen with creative messages that make you laugh, cringe, or question your choices.

5. Repeat as Needed:
Try different names. Try your ex. Try your pet. Try your best friend‚Äôs situationship. It‚Äôs addictive.

> *Disclaimer: Match Breaker is purely for fun and entertainment. Do not break up based on the breaker score (unless it‚Äôs really accurate‚Ä¶ then maybe). üòâ
